# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project

## Purpose
Academic dishonesty has occured. Thomas High School ninth graders  reading and math scores appear to have been altered. My job is to 
replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Then repeat the school 
district analysis with the updated data.

## Analysis and Challenges
There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data 

### Results

- How is the district summary affected?
  The scores and percentages are off only by a tenth of a point or two.

- How is the school summary affected?
  Only Thomas High School Percent Passing Math, Percent Passing Reading, and Percent Overall Passing is affected. All other scholls not         affected.
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  The scores for Percent(Math, REading, Overall) went from bottom five of schoold district to the top 5 in each category. They were actually     number one in Percent Passing Reading.

- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
 - Math and reading scores by grade
    Only Ninth grade was affected. Removing the Thomas Ninth grade scores caused the overall ninth grade to drop by two tenths of a point.
 - Scores by school spending
    No difference in spending
 - Scores by school size
    No difference by school size
 - Scores by school type
    No difference by school type
